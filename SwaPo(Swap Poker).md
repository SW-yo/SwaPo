## What You Need

A standard deck of playing cards including one Joker (53 cards total)

- For larger groups, add more decks or reshuffle discarded cards as needed

## Number of Players

2–10 players (4–6 players is ideal)

## How to Play

### 1. Determine the Dealer

Use one of the following methods:

- Each player draws from a set of cards equal to the number of players (including the Joker). Whoever draws the Joker becomes the dealer.
- Each player draws from a random set of cards. The player with the highest card becomes the dealer. Card ranking: Joker > A > K > Q > J > 10 > ... > 2 (Suit ranking: Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs)

### 2. Shuffle and Create the Draw Pile

### 3. Draw Your Hand

Use one of the following methods:

- Starting with the dealer, each player draws 5 cards at once
- Starting with the dealer and going clockwise, each player draws one card at a time until everyone has 5 cards

### 4. Playing a Round (One Turn)

**Swap Rules:**

- Each player has one swap opportunity per round
- Swaps are conducted one-on-one
    1. Choose an opponent (the chosen player must comply; the same player can be chosen by multiple people)
    2. Specify the number of cards (the player with the swap right decides; can be anywhere from 0 cards (no swap) to 5 cards (complete exchange))
    3. Both players select the specified number of cards from their hand and exchange them
- Swap rights are exercised in order, starting from the dealer and going clockwise until reaching the player to the dealer's right
- After all swaps are complete, everyone reveals their hand

### 5. Scoring

- The player(s) with the most cards of the same number in their 5-card hand wins
- The Joker acts as a wild card
- Multiple players can win if they tie (shared victory)
- Winners receive +1 point
- After determining the winner(s), all hands are discarded (cards are not reused in that game)

### 6. Subsequent Rounds

- In the next round, players draw cards from the pile in the same manner
- Continue as before
- If there are many players and few rounds, decide on a final round number in advance and reshuffle all cards (including the draw pile and hands)

### 7. Final Victory

- Continue until no more cards can be drawn from the pile
- The player with the most points wins
- In case of a tie, the player who scored their first point in an earlier round wins (alternatively: the player who scored their last point in a later round, or the player who scored their first point in a later round)
- If still tied, reshuffle all cards, rebuild the draw pile, and play sudden death (first player to pull ahead by even one point wins)

## 8. Additional Rules

- Card counting is allowed if done by memory only (no note-taking or device use)
- During a turn, players must not reveal their hand
- [For Adults] However, talking about your hand is allowed
- [For Adults] Lying is permitted
- [For Adults] Negotiation is allowed
- [For Adults] You do not have to give the cards agreed upon in negotiations

## 9. SwaPo Dagger (SwaPo†)

- Before swapping begins, all players lay their hand face-down on the table
- Once laid down, no one may touch the cards until all swaps are complete
- The player with the swap right selects cards from their opponent's layout and swaps them with their own cards (keeping them face-down)
- After all swaps are complete, players may check and rearrange their hand

## 10. SwaPo Asterisk (SwaPo*)

- Swaps are not limited to a single opponent (you may take cards from multiple opponents)
- However, cards that have already been swapped cannot be swapped again
